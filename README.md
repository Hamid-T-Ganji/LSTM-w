# LSTM-based surrogate modeling proposal for dynamic response prediction of buried structures in random soil half-space and earthquake wave field
In this paper, we present an altered version of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modeling approach, which we apply to predict the seismic response of tunnel structures. The modified LSTM model can process scalar and time-dependent random variables as inputs, allowing for the quantification of uncertainty in the system of interest. Furthermore, our model has the advantage of employing synthetic loads with a short duration of only one second during the training phase, as opposed to actual earthquake data. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methodology in three stages. First, we use it to predict the seismic response of 20 nodes of the tunnel structure under 14 different earthquake ground motions, each with varying peak ground acceleration and duration. Subsequently, we apply our approach to predict the racking displacement of tunnel columns and perform uncertainty quantification. Finally, we use our surrogate model for analyzing the sensitivity of the tunnel's racking response to the input random variables of the model. Our results indicate that the proposed method can accurately predict the distribution of a high-fidelity finite element model, with errors of %3 in the mean and %0.2 in the standard deviation, while significantly speeding up the prediction time by more than two orders of magnitude.
